					<h3>Introduction</h3>

					<h3>Early Life</h3>
					<p>I was born in Shanghai,China. I have been living in Shanghai for the first 18 years of my life.
						And then my dad decided to send me abroad to broaden my horizon. So he sent me to an international
						high school in China and then I came to the US. I did not really like SAT and TOEFL but I spent a great
						amount of time making my essay interesting. And that essay is how I got into Rochester and I like
						the snow in Rochester a lot! (Although many people might not agree with me, Rochester is very pretty in my mind).</p>
