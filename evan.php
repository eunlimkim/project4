                    <h3>Introduction</h3>

                    <p>I am a student at the University of Rochester, which is located in Rochester, NY. My major is
                        undecided, but I plan on minoring in computer science. I grew up in the Washington D.C. area. I
                        have been involved in activities such as running competitively and snowboarding.</p>
