# Website CRAP critiques from lab 6: #
- (Contrast) Navigation menu elements have different colors when they're alll on the same level/triple (website has student pages)
  - Suggestion: Remove contrasting colors for elements belonging to the same triple
- (Proximity) On the homepage, the sections for each student are too close together, and it makes it seem as if they are one entity.
  - Suggestion: Add space between each student introduction to help separate them.
- (Contrast) At the bottom of each subpage, there is a button linking to the original lab 1 assignment. This button is the same color as that page’s navigation bar element which indicates to the user that the button will link to something related to the page you are currently on (possibly returning you to the top of the current page).
  - Suggestion: Make that button a different color and move it further down the page, away from the main content of the page. The increased separation and a different color will make it clear it is linking to something unrelated to the current page. 
- (Contrast) When the yellow buttons are hovered, the text becomes white, making it slightly hard to read on the yellow background
  - Suggestion: Give the text a darker color when hovered or pick a darker color for the background
- (Contrast) While I like the dark themed website, the contrast between the font and background is too much, and after a while my eyes hurt trying to read it. 
  - Suggestion: Make the font less bright or make the background less dark.
- (Repetetion) Overall, I love the repetition of box themes in each page- in each page, the sections are contained and arranged in the same way. However, the repetition should have been expanded and shrunk in different ways. First, I wish the repetition to be expanded in a way that all headings in each student page are about the same contents- for example, currently, some student pages have “Work Experience” section while others don’t and have other content headings instead. Here the website could benefit from some repetition. Secondly, I love that the colorful navigation bar is against a black background, and that each person has their own color- yet I wish the assigned colors could have broken the repetition of black in the individual pages and reflected some individual styles. 
- (Contrast) The titles, no matter h1 or h2, and paragraphs are all white. When I browsed the website, it is hard to know what each section is about and also differences between sections.
  - Suggestion: Titles and paragraphs can be decorated with different colors in order to emphasize the main topic for each section, making a contrast between titles and contents.
- (Contrast) Using the white font throughout sometimes made it hard to read/ understand what the different content was. Like for the navigation bar, the current and hovering turned text white which made it hard to read against the bright colors. The white font also didn’t put much contrasts between the h1, h2, and paragraphs. 
  - Suggestion: Change the headings to different colors to make it evident that they are headings. For the nav bar, make the hovering and current color into a color that is easier to read against those colors.
