                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>I'm currently a student at the University of Rochester, class of 2021.
                    I'm majoring in Computer Science with a focus in Human Computer Interaction.
                    I'm also minoring in International Relations. When I'm not busy building
                    complex worlds, I like to write and draw in my spare time. My main goal is to
                    pursue a career in the "creative side" of computer science, more specifically
                    Front-End Web Development and Video Game Development.</p>

                <h3>Early Life</h3>
                <p>Ever since I was young, I've had a natural affinity for writing, creative
                    writing specifically. So I spent years creating complex worlds and figuring out how
                    they would operate if it was the setting for a video game. It wasn't until I
                    was introduced to the book series "The 39 Clues" that I realized how websites
                    could be used as a medium for creativity. The series had a website dedicated
                    to expanding the world presented inside the book in ways I had never seen before,
                    with games, puzzles and an overall interactive website that engaged users.
                    It was then that I started writing designs for websites for worlds I created, thus
                    marking my start into being interested in visual media.</p>
